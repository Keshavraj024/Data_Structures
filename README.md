# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This C++ program demonstrates a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation using smart pointers. It allows inserting elements into the tree, checking if an element exists, and printing the tree using an in-order traversal.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o binary_search_tree binary_search_tree.cpp
./binary_search_tree
```
# C++ Stack Implementation

## Description

This is a simple C++ implementation of a Stack data structure using a linked list. The Stack class allows you to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the top of the stack, and print the elements currently in the stack.

## Features

- Push elements onto the stack.
- Pop elements from the top of the stack.
- Print the elements currently in the stack.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program and run the executable.

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o stack stack.cpp
./stack
```

# C++ Queue Implementation

## Description

This is a simple C++ implementation of a Queue data structure using a linked list. The Queue class allows you to enqueue elements to the end of the queue, dequeue elements from the front of the queue, print the elements currently in the queue, and get the length of the queue.

## Features

- Enqueue elements to the end of the queue.
- Dequeue elements from the front of the queue.
- Print the elements currently in the queue.
- Get the length of the queue.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o queue queue.cpp
./queue
```
