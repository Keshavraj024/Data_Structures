# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This C++ program demonstrates a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation using smart pointers. It allows inserting elements into the tree, checking if an element exists, and printing the tree using an in-order traversal.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o binary_search_tree binary_search_tree.cpp
./binary_search_tree
```
# C++ Stack Implementation

## Description

This is a simple C++ implementation of a Stack data structure using a linked list. The Stack class allows you to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the top of the stack, and print the elements currently in the stack.

## Features

- Push elements onto the stack.
- Pop elements from the top of the stack.
- Print the elements currently in the stack.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program and run the executable.

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o stack stack.cpp
./stack
```

# C++ Queue Implementation

## Description

This is a simple C++ implementation of a Queue data structure using a linked list. The Queue class allows you to enqueue elements to the end of the queue, dequeue elements from the front of the queue, print the elements currently in the queue, and get the length of the queue.

## Features

- Enqueue elements to the end of the queue.
- Dequeue elements from the front of the queue.
- Print the elements currently in the queue.
- Get the length of the queue.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o queue queue.cpp
./queue
```

# Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

This contains a C++ implementation of a Doubly Linked List. A Doubly Linked List is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next and previous elements in the sequence.

## Features

- Appending elements to the end of the list.
- Deleting the last element from the list.
- Prepending elements to the beginning of the list.
- Deleting the first element from the list.
- Inserting elements at a specific index in the list.
- Deleting an element at a specific index from the list.
- Setting the value of an element at a specific index.
- Printing the list elements in forward order.
- Getting the head and tail elements.
- Getting the length of the list.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o dll doubly_linked.cpp 
./dll
```

# HashTable

This contains a C++ implementation of a HashTable data structure. The HashTable is designed to store key-value pairs, and it uses a simple hash function to map keys to specific indices in an array.

## Features

- Insert key-value pairs into the HashTable.
- Retrieve values associated with specific keys.
- Print all the key-value pairs in the HashTable.
- Get a list of all the keys stored in the HashTable.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o ht hash_map.cpp 
./ht
```
