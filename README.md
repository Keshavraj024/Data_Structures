# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This C++ program demonstrates a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation using smart pointers. It allows inserting elements into the tree, checking if an element exists, and printing the tree using an in-order traversal.

## Usage

Compile the program and run the executable:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o binary_search_tree binary_search_tree.cpp
./binary_search_tree
```
# C++ Stack Implementation

## Description

This is a simple C++ implementation of a Stack data structure using a linked list. The Stack class allows you to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the top of the stack, and print the elements currently in the stack.

## Features

- Push elements onto the stack.
- Pop elements from the top of the stack.
- Print the elements currently in the stack.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program and run the executable.

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o stack stack.cpp
./stack
```
